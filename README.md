Homework n1, Advanced Programming Course held by professor Leoni David 

The chosen device is a catapult.
Its variable parameters are:
- wheel radius
- arm length 
- launch angle
- hight of the structure holding the arm
- hight of the base

Based uppon the variables stated above there are several constraints:
- all dimensions must be >0 and < of a certain max value
- hc < 2 times the radius
- the launch angle is limited and depends on hc
