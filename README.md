Based uppon the variables stated above there are several constraints:
- all dimensions must be > 0 and < of a certain max value
- hc < 2 times the radius
- the launch angle is limited and depends on hc


## Machine: catapult + car
The user will be able to configure both car and catapult.
The result will bee a svg file such as:
